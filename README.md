    This article provides a detailed analysis of the connection and similarities between the filmmaking process and the software engineering process. As a Film and TV and Computer Science double major, I find myself constantly struggling to balance between these two subjects since they appear to be two completely different projects. The article mentioned that how a film crew works together is in many ways similar to how people in a software engineering team collaborate with each other. They both separate a big task into multiple smaller tasks and assign a leader for each team. For example, every department in a film crew has a leader. DoP is the head of the camera department; Gaffer is the head of the electric department, and Key Grip is the head of the grip department. This is similar to the separation between front-end developers and back-end developers. The incremental methodologies in software engineering, as we talked in class, is also very similar to the process of filmmaking, which includes different phases such as the pre-produciton phase, the production phase, and the post-production phase. This article inspired me to use my collaboration and communication skills developed through my filmmaking experiences in the highly collaborative process of software engineering.
